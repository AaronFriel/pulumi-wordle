# Wordle Pulumi Provider

Play Wordle while writing infrastructure as code. If you're working from an office, your boss won't
even know that you aren't deploying state of the art cloud managed NAT gateways!

Every day the game resets, and the word list should be the same as the original Wordle's. But unlike
the real Wordle this one gives you unlimited retries, just like deploying real infrastructure.

An example of using the single resource defined in this example is in `examples/simple`.

```
$ pulumi up
Please choose a stack, or create a new one: dev
